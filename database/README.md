# Database

1. Create the database: `CREATE DATABASE school_erp_system;`
2. Run the backend - Hibernate will create tables automatically.
3. Default admin is created on first run: `admin` / `admin123`
4. Default badges (Rising Star, Academic Achiever, etc.) are created on first run.

No seed data - add data through the application UI.
